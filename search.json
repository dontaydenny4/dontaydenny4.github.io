They recently joined the American Athletic Conference in which many people thought they would fall off. UNT just finished their second season in the AAC in which they finished 2nd in the conference behind the Memphis Tigers who earned a 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament in March.\nUNT fans have seen time and time again how good defensively this Mean Green team can be over this season and the past few seasons. They were dominant in the Conference USA when Grant McCasland was at the helm leading the Eagles. North Texas was near the top in a few defensive categories in their first season last year in the American Athletic Conference, but the question is, were they the best this season defensively in the American Athletic Conference?\nThe first thing that we will look at in comparison with North Texas and the rest of the AAC teams is defensive efficiency. Defensive efficiency measures how well a team can stop or prevent the other team from being able to score per 100 possessions. You typically hope for the defensive efficiency to be the lowest.\n\n\nCode\nTheAmericanStats |&gt;\n  select(Team, DefEfficiency) |&gt;\n  arrange(DefEfficiency) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(DefEfficiency = \"Defensive Efficiency\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How does UNT compare with the AAC in terms of defensive efficiency?\",\n    subtitle = \"UNT sits at the top of the AAC, being the most efficient defense.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = \"By Dontay Denny\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: ESPN.COM\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Team)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#00853E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"UNT\")\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does UNT compare with the AAC in terms of defensive efficiency?\n\n\nUNT sits at the top of the AAC, being the most efficient defense.\n\n\nTeam\nDefensive Efficiency\n\n\n\n\nUNT\n0.966\n\n\nMemphis\n0.996\n\n\nWichSt\n1.019\n\n\nTulane\n1.024\n\n\nRice\n1.028\n\n\nUSF\n1.040\n\n\nTulsa\n1.053\n\n\nECU\n1.054\n\n\nFAU\n1.055\n\n\nUAB\n1.058\n\n\nTemple\n1.064\n\n\nUTSA\n1.079\n\n\nCharlotte\n1.101\n\n\n\nBy Dontay Denny\n\n\nSource: ESPN.COM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Texas has the best defensive efficiency in the entire American Athletic Conference which shows that their defense was the most efficient in their conference alone and the top defensive efficiency in the nation was Houston with 0.896, another team that used to be in the American Athletic Conference.\nBut where does UNT sit in terms of how many steals they get, blocks, and forced turnovers. Three important aspects of a good defensive team.\n\n\nCode\nUNT &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"UNT\")\nMemphis &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"Memphis\")\nWichSt &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"WichSt\")\nTulane &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"Tulane\")\nRice &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team== \"Rice\")\nUSF &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"USF\")\nTulsa &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team== \"Tulsa\")\nECU &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"ECU\")\nFAU &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"FAU\")\nUAB &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"UAB\")\nTemple &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"Temple\")\nUTSA &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"UTSA\")\nCharlotte &lt;- TheAmericanStats |&gt; filter(Team == \"Charlotte\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = UNT,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size=ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#00853E\",\n    alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Memphis,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size=ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#003087\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = WichSt,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#FFDB00\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Tulane,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#43B02A\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Rice,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size=ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#00205B\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = USF,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#CFC493\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Tulsa,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#002D72\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = ECU,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#592A8A\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = FAU,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#CC0000\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = UAB,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#CC8A00\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Temple,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#9D2235\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = UTSA,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#F15A22\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = Charlotte,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, size = ForcedTO),\n    color=\"#005035\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = TheAmericanStats,\n    aes(x=Steals, y=Blocks, label = Team)\n  ) +\n  labs(x=\"Steals\", y=\"Blocks\", title = \"Where does UNT stand in the AAC in terms of steals, blocks and forced turnovers?\", subtitle = \"UNT is near the top in steals and forced turnovers, but at the bottom in blocks.\", caption = \"Source: ESPN.Com | By Dontay Denny\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this chart, we can see that despite being the best in the conference in terms of defensive efficiency, UNT has some of their own defensive struggles, like getting blocks. UNT ranks in the top four of the conference for forced turnovers and steals, but among the bottom of the conference in blocks.\nThe next chart we look at will show how good UNT did in terms of points allowed per game in the American Athletic Conference compared to the top three teams in the conference in terms of points allowed.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = TheAmericanStats, aes(x=reorder(Team, AllowedPPG), weight = AllowedPPG)) +\n  geom_bar(data = UNT, aes(x=reorder(Team, AllowedPPG), weight = AllowedPPG), fill=\"#00853E\") +\n  labs(x=\"\", y=\"Points Allowed Per Game\", title = \"Where does UNT stand in the AAC in terms of allowed point per game?\", subtitle = \"UNT is at the top in terms of allowing the least amount of points per game.\", caption = \"Source: ESPN.Com | By Dontay Denny\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from this graph, UNT is significantly better in terms of the amount of points they give up per game compared to everyone else in the conference. This doesn’t mean that they have the absolute best defense in the American Athletic Conference, but UNT has a top level defense in the American Athletic Conference and will continue to get better as a team."
