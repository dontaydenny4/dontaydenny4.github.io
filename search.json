They recently joined the American Athletic Conference in which many people thought they would fall off. UNT just finished their second season in the AAC in which they finished 2nd in the conference behind the Memphis Tigers who earned a 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament in March.\nUNT fans have seen time and time again how good defensively this Mean Green team can be over this season and the past few seasons. They were dominant in the Conference USA when Grant McCasland was at the helm leading the Eagles. North Texas was near the top in a few defensive categories in their first season last year in the American Athletic Conference, but the question is, were they the best this season defensively in the American Athletic Conference?\nThe first thing that we will look at in comparison with North Texas and the rest of the AAC teams is defensive efficiency. Defensive efficiency measures how well a team can stop or prevent the other team from being able to score per 100 possessions. You typically hope for the defensive efficiency to be the lowest.\n\n\nCode\nTheAmericanStats |&gt;\n  select(Team, DefEfficiency) |&gt;\n  arrange(DefEfficiency) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(DefEfficiency = \"Defensive Efficiency\") |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How does UNT compare with the AAC in terms of defensive efficiency?\",\n    subtitle = \"UNT sits at the top of the AAC, being the most efficient defense.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = \"By Dontay Denny\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: ESPN.COM\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = c(Team)\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#00853E\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"UNT\")\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does UNT compare with the AAC in terms of defensive efficiency?\n\n\nUNT sits at the top of the AAC, being the most efficient defense.\n\n\nTeam\nDefensive Efficiency\n\n\n\n\nUNT\n0.966\n\n\nMemphis\n0.996\n\n\nWichSt\n1.019\n\n\nTulane\n1.024\n\n\nRice\n1.028\n\n\nUSF\n1.040\n\n\nTulsa\n1.053\n\n\nECU\n1.054\n\n\nFAU\n1.055\n\n\nUAB\n1.058\n\n\nTemple\n1.064\n\n\nUTSA\n1.079\n\n\nCharlotte\n1.101\n\n\n\nBy Dontay Denny\n\n\nSource: ESPN.COM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Texas has the best defensive efficiency in the entire American Athletic Conference which shows that their defense was the most efficient in their conference alone and the top defensive efficiency in the nation was Houston with 0.896, another team that used to be in the American Athletic Conference.\nBut where does UNT sit in terms of how many steals they get, blocks, and forced turnovers.

UNT ranks in the top four of the conference for forced turnovers and steals, but among the bottom of the conference in blocks.\nThe next chart we look at will show how good UNT did in terms of points allowed per game in the American Athletic Conference compared to the top three teams in the conference in terms of points allowed.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = TheAmericanStats, aes(x=reorder(Team, AllowedPPG), weight = AllowedPPG)) +\n  geom_bar(data = UNT, aes(x=reorder(Team, AllowedPPG), weight = AllowedPPG), fill=\"#00853E\") +\n  labs(x=\"\", y=\"Points Allowed Per Game\", title = \"Where does UNT stand in the AAC in terms of allowed point per game?\", subtitle = \"UNT is at the top in terms of allowing the least amount of points per game.\", caption = \"Source: ESPN.Com | By Dontay Denny\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell from this graph, UNT is significantly better in terms of the amount of points they give up per game compared to everyone else in the conference. This doesn’t mean that they have the absolute best defense in the American Athletic Conference, but UNT has a top level defense in the American Athletic Conference and will continue to get better as a team."

This past college football season, UNT had completed just their second season playing in the American Athletic Conference(AAC) and despite many people expecting them to take a massive tumble, UNT has held their own and stayed around .500 or 11-14 overall in the two seasons playing in the AAC.\nUNT fans have desperately been waiting on an exciting product to be put on the gridiron to match the level of their basketball team. The North Texas football team has not had a winning season since the Mason Fine days in 2018 when quarterback Mason Fine was able to lead the Mean Green to back to back nine win seasons.\nThe first thing that we are going to look at for UNT is how the compared to the rest of the AAC in terms of how much they turned the ball over and how many turnovers that they forced over the course of the entire season.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data = CFBAAC,\n    aes(y=reorder(Team, ForcedTO), x=ForcedTO, xend = TO),\n    size = 2,\n     colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Turnovers vs forced turnovers in the AAC\",\n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;forced turnovers&lt;/span&gt;are on the right, that's good.

The chart shows that North Texas turned the ball over a significant more amount of times than they were able to force a turnover.\nThe next chart that we will look at to compare UNT to the rest of the AAC is a stacked bar chart that will help compare and show how UNT stacked up amongst the conference in rushing, passing and total yards per game on the season.\n\n\nCode\ncfb &lt;- AACStats |&gt;\n  group_by(Team,RushYPG, PassYPG) \n\ncfblonger &lt;- cfb |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ends_with(\"YPG\"),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Yards\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = cfblonger, aes(x=reorder(Team,Yards), weight = Yards, fill = Type)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(x= \"Team\", y= \"Total Yards Per Game\", title = \"UNT had one of the more prolific offenses in the AAC last season.\", subtitle = \"They led the conference in total yards per game.\", caption = \"Source: Stats.Ncaa.Org | By: Dontay Denny\" ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from this chart, offense was not the issue at North Texas. Their offense seamlessly moved the ball on everyone they played despite finishing the season with a 6-7 record on the year. The one negative takeaway we can bring from this chart is that UNT needs some more consistency when it comes to running the ball.\nThe next chart we look at will be a bubble chart that takes a look at how UNT performed in terms of yards per play on offense and defense and how that compares with the win total on the season.\n\n\nCode\nUNT &lt;- AAC2 |&gt; filter(Team == \"UNT\")\n\nAAC2 |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    offense = mean(YardsPerPlay),\n    defense = mean(DefYdsPerPlay)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  offense defense\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    5.84    5.79\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data = AAC2,\n    aes(x=YardsPerPlay, y=DefYdsPerPlay, size = AACWins),\n    color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data = UNT,\n    aes(x=YardsPerPlay, y=DefYdsPerPlay, size = AACWins),\n    color=\"#00853E\",\n    alpha=.3) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.842857) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.785714) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = AAC2,\n    aes(x=YardsPerPlay, y=DefYdsPerPlay, label = Team)\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x=\"Offense Yards Per Play\", y= \"Defense Yards Per Play\", title = \"UNT is superior in offensive yards per play but struggles on the defense side.\", subtitle = \"UNT defense does not do it's job which results in less wins.\", caption = \"Source: stats.ncaa.org | By: Dontay Denny\") +\n  annotate(\"rect\", fill=\"blue\", alpha = 0.1,\n           xmin = 5.85, xmax = Inf,\n           ymin = 4.5, ymax = 5.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6.25, y=5.0, label = \"Good team zone\"), size = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the chart, UNT was far superior of every team in their conference when it comes to Offensive yards per play, however, they are one of the worst teams in their conference when it comes to how many yards they give up per play on the defensive side of things. Many teams can sometimes use extraordinary offense to make up for a bad defense, but in UNT’s case they were unable to as they only finished with 3 conference wins.\nThe next and last chart that I will show will compare the total yards given up per game and points given up per game between UNT and the rest of the AAC.\n\n\nCode\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = AAC2, aes(x=reorder(Team, DefTotYds), weight = DefTotYds), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = UNT, aes(x=reorder(Team, DefTotYds), weight = DefTotYds), fill=\"#00853E\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Average yards given up per game\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = AAC2, aes(x=reorder(Team, AllowedPPG), weight=AllowedPPG), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data = UNT, aes(x=reorder(Team, AllowedPPG), weight = AllowedPPG), fill=\"#00853E\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Points given up per game\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar1 + bar2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"UNT gives up nearly the most yards and points per game\",\n    subtitle = \"This is not a recipe for success even if the offense is dominant\",\n    caption = \"Source: stats.ncaa.org | By: Dontay Denny\"\n  ) &\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, North Texas is a middle of the road AAC team currently. In order for the Mean Green to figure things out and become one of the more potent teams to face out of the AAC, they must figure out an answer on the defensive side of things in terms of forcing more turnovers and allowing less yards and points.The Eagles will also have to stay consistent on offense and continue to excel on that side of things."
